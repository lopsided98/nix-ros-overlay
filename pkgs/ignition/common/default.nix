      Ignition Common, a component of Ignition Robotics, provides a set of
      libraries that cover many different use cases. An audio-visual library
      supports processing audio and video files, a graphics library can load a
      variety 3D mesh file formats into a generic in-memory representation, and
      the core library of Ignition Common contains functionality that spans
      Base64 encoding/decoding to thread pools.
