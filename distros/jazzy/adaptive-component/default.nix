    Allows building Nodes that can select between FPGA, CPU or
    GPU, at run-time. Stateless by default, can be made stateful
    to meet use-case specific needs. Refer to examples in README.

    Technically, provides A ROS 2 Node subclass programmed as a
    &quot;Component&quot; and including its own single threaded executor
    to build adaptive computations. Adaptive ROS 2 Nodes are able to
    perform computations in the CPU, the FPGA or the GPU, adaptively.
    Adaptive behavior is controlled through the &quot;adaptive&quot; ROS 2
    parameter.";
