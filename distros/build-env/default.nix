# Provides a specialized version of buildEnv, designed specifically for ROS
# packages. It is useful when using a large number of ROS packages that would
# otherwise cause ROS_PACKAGE_PATH or other environment variables to become too
# long.
#
# All ROS packages in the 'paths' closure are added to the environment, while
# other packages are propagated. This makes it usable in nix-shell, while
# preventing ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH from becoming too large due
# to a huge number of ROS packages.
#
# By default, all binaries in the environment are wrapped, setting the relevant
# ROS environment variables, allowing use outside of nix-shell.
