        This package contains the robot model that is used by the realtime
        controllers
        inside <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_controller_manager">controller
           manager</a>. This robot model focuses on controlling the robot
        mechanism in a realtime control loop, and therefore it only contains
        the components of a robot that are relevant in realtime: the robot
        joints (with encoders, transmisisons and actuators) and the
        kinematic/dynamic model of the robot.
     </p>
     <p>
        The pr2_mechanism_model package is well tested and is released with a stable API.
