    <p>
      This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files
      for ABB IRB 4400 manipulators. This currently includes the L30.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the
      <a href="http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot352.nsf/veritydisplay/c90b98aaa057bd6ec12576cb00528ef6/$file/Product%20specification%204400%20M99%20BWOS3.2.pdf">
      ABB IRB 4400 product specification document</a> (Article No: 3HAC 8770-1).
      All urdfs / xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity
      limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints,
      extended / limited motion ranges or other options).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included
      in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular
      robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
