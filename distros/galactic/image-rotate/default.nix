      Contains a node that rotates an image stream in a way that minimizes
      the angle between a vector in some arbitrary frame and a vector in the
      camera frame. The frame of the outgoing image is published by the node.
    </p>
    <p>
      This node is intended to allow camera images to be visualized in an
      orientation that is more intuitive than the hardware-constrained
      orientation of the physical camera. This is particularly helpful, for
      example, to show images from the PR2's forearm cameras with a
      consistent up direction, despite the fact that the forearms need to
      rotate in arbitrary ways during manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not recommended to use the output from this node for further
      computation, as it interpolates the source image, introduces black
      borders, and does not output a camera_info.
