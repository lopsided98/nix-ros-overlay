      streams provided by Roboception's stereo camera with self-localization.
      See http://rc-visard.com

      Dynamic-state estimates of the rc_visard relate to its self-localization and
      ego-motion estimation. These states refer to rc_visard's current pose,
      velocity, or acceleration and are published on demand via several data streams.
      For a complete list and descriptions of these dynamics states and the
      respective data streams please refer to rc_visard's user manual.'';
