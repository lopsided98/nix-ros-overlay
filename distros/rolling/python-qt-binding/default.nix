    There are two providers: pyside and pyqt.  PySide2 is available under
    the GPL, LGPL and a commercial license.  PyQt is released under the GPL.

    Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from each
    available provider.  For PySide, it is called &quot;Shiboken&quot;.  For PyQt,
    this is called &quot;SIP&quot;.

    Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python code
    independent of which binding provider was actually used which makes
    it very easy to switch between these.";
