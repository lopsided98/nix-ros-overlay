   rqt_robot_monitor is a direct port to rqt of
   <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_monitor">robot_monitor</a>. All
   diagnostics are fall into one of three tree panes depending on the status of
   diagnostics (normal, warning, error/stale). Status are shown in trees to
   represent their hierarchy. Worse status dominates the higher level status.<br/>
   <ul>
    Ex. 'Computer' category has 3 sub devices. 2 are green but 1 is error. Then
        'Computer' becomes error.
   </ul>
  You can look at the detail of each status by double-clicking the tree nodes.<br/>
