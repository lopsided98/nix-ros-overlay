    description = ''This package wraps the external c++ library opengm in a ROS package, so other packages can use it. It downloads the source code of it and then unzips it. The library is a header-only library with command line interfaces, which aren't used, so it doesn't gets build. For further descriptions and tutorials see the Makefile.tarball and https://github.com/opengm/opengm .
