    description = ''TRAC-IK is a faster, significantly more reliable drop-in replacement for
    KDL's pseudoinverse Jacobian solver.

    The TRAC-IK library has a very similar API to KDL's IK solver calls,
    except that the user passes a maximum time instead of a maximum number of
    search iterations.  Additionally, TRAC-IK allows for error tolerances to
    be set independently for each Cartesian dimension (x,y,z,roll,pitch.yaw).'';
