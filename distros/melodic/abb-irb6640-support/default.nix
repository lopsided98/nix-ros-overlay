      ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 6640 (and variants).
    </p>
    <p>
      This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files
      for ABB IRB 6640 manipulators. This currently includes the
      IRB 6640-185/2.8m (6640-185) only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the
      <a href="http://www.abbrobots.co.uk/en/3HAC028284-en.pdf">ABB IRB 6640
      technical data sheet</a> (Version: 3HAC 028284-001 Rev. N). All urdfs /
      xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless
      noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited
      motion ranges or other options).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included
      in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular
      robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
